The <I>SECURE 1000</I> is an electronic imaging system used to detect
weapons, explosives, drugs, and other dangerous objects concealed under persons'
clothing.  The person being examined stands in front of the system for a 3 second
front scan (as shown), and then turns around for a 3 second rear scan.  A digital image is
immediately displayed on the security operator's computer screen showing the shape and
location of objects hidden under the clothing.<P>

These are typical images produced by the <I>SECURE 1000</I>.  Several
concealed objects can be seen in the front scan: plastic explosive (on the chest), .38
caliber handgun, coins in the pocket, snaps on the trousers, screwdriver, and a metal
watchband.  The shin bones can also be seen since they are very near the skin.
Concealed objects in the rear scan: C4 explosive, .38 caliber bullets, wallet, hunting
knife.<P>

The <I>SECURE 1000 </I> operates by scanning the subject with a narrow beam of
x-rays.  Some of these x-rays will penetrate a few millimeters into the body, backscatter
(reflect) in the opposite direction, and be gathered by sensitive x-ray detectors. 
Advanced image processing algorithms use this information to generate the images.<P>

The level of radiation used by the <I>SECURE 1000 </I> is about the same as 5
minutes exposure to natural background radiation, or 20 seconds on a commercial airline
flight.  This radiation dose is classified as "trivial, completely negligible, and not
warranting consideration for purposes of radiation protection."  Approximately 150
of these systems are in operation in the United States, Mexico, Argentina and Puerto
Rico.  The <I>SECURE 1000 </I> took 5 years to develop.  For <I>SECURE 1000 </I> sales
