<br><font color="#000099">&nbsp;&nbsp; The front cover illustrates the
image detected by your right eye as you stand a few feet from the Mona
Lisa. The gray filaments are regions where you are totally blind, a result
of blood vessels in the retina blocking the detection of light.&nbsp; Likewise,
the large rectangular region is where the optic nerve connects with the
retina, where humans are also sightless.&nbsp; This is called the blind
spot, and is really quite large, about the size of an apple at arm’s length.&nbsp;
As long as your eye remains fixed on the center of the painting, these
gray regions are totally blocked from your gaze; you perceive nothing about
the image in these areas.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000099">&nbsp; When you first looked at the cover, you
probably wondered what the gray spider-like pattern represented.&nbsp;
It probably struck you as quite odd, like something out of a bad science
fiction movie.&nbsp; It was totally unfamiliar and foreign to your conscious
experience.&nbsp; But how could this possibly be?&nbsp; This pattern has
been superimposed on your visual field since you first opened your eyes
as an infant.&nbsp; Even as you read this paragraph the pattern is present.&nbsp;
It should be more familiar to you than anything you have ever seen.&nbsp;
How is it possible that our conscious experience knows nothing of these
blind areas?&nbsp;</font>
